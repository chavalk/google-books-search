## Description

An application built to allow the user to search for a book and to save any of the books to be accessed later.

## What the project does

The project uses the Google Books API to provide results to users based on the query entered. It allows users to save books to be accessed later and to click the view button to see the book in the Google Play Store. The user can also delete any saved books by navigating to the savde books page. Below is a GIF showing the navigation of the application.

## Why is the project useful

Personally the project was a great experience for me on making an application using the MERN stack from scratch. For users, the application is useful in offering an option to search for books from the Google Play Store and to be able to save them to keep track of them.
